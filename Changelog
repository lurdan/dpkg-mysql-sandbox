	  to detect the failure.

	  scripts will write an entry to that file with their run time params.
3.0.11	24-May-2010
	- Fixed bug in ./clear script. In version 5.5 and bigger, it erased

	  executed in a clean mode.
	- Added a script to install plugins in ./drafts

	- improved test suite with the ability of running from one or more
	  tarballs instead of the default directories ([$HOME]/opt/mysql)
1.99.6 28-Jun-2008
	- enhanced the "clear" script. Now it removes all databases form the
	  data directory, first trying via SQL, then using the OS.

	  with options --master_master and --topology={standard|circular} .
	  This feature uses make_multiple_sandbox internally.

	  directory.
1.99.4 21-Jun-2008

		set_replication.pl -> make_replication_sandbox

	  was only looking under "./support-files" while recent packaging use
	  "./share/mysql"
    - fixed Bug#240121, with a collision between my_file and replication.
	- added the execution of a "./clear" command when "--force" was used
	  to avoid overwriting a running server.
	- cleaned up current_changes to contain only not empty options
	- created a basic test suite (not in distribution yet, only in RCS)
1.21 09-Jun-2008

	  have clashing port numbers.

1.13 23-Oct-2007
	- (INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE) removed '.sh' suffix from all scripts

	  to send a query to each node.
	- added a 'my' script to call mysql* tools
	- fixed bug about using 6.0 binaries on Mac OS X (dynamic library
	  path requires a different environment variable)

    - bugs fixed:
        -- clear.sh was using $HOME directory instead of _HOME_DIR_
